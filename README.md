We chose to create a Beer Industry guideline because we love beers. JAGS Brewery is the go to place for finding all things-related to Beer Brewery.

# &nbsp;Overview

## How We Built JAGS website

The project was designed using a combination several technologies such as React, JS, CSS, Google API map and News API. Further, we also use Coolers.io to pick images, Material UI to help design the front-end, BrandCrowd for logo design, and Trello to as our project management app. We developed this project in two weeks.
